# Security Policy

## Reporting a security vulnerability

We take security seriously at Simplifai and strongly encourage responsible disclosure of any vulnerabilities affecting our SaaS platform at [studio.simplifai.ai](https://studio.simplifai.ai).

If you believe you have discovered a security issue, please report it privately to our security team by emailing **secure[@]simplifai.ai**. Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues or pull requests.

Please include as much detail as possible to help us understand and address the issue. This might include, but not limited to:

- Authentication or authorization issues
- Remote code execution, XSS, etc.
- Denial of service

## Working together

We value your time and appreciate your help in keeping our platform secure. We will work with you to resolve any issues.

- **Do not** publicly disclose vulnerabilities before we have had a chance to investigate and respond.
- We will acknowledge receipt of your report and keep you informed of our progress.
- We do not currently operate a public bug bounty program, but we are open to negotiation and appreciate your efforts.

Thank you for helping us and others stay secure!
